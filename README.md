<h2> Wireless door lock </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>The designed system operates a door lock, granting access to a property only to individuals that transmit a valid access code using a signal-broadcasting device (remote, smart watch, smartphone, tablet, etc.) and displays the lock status and welcoming messages on an LCD screen. For further visual feedback, a RGB LED lights green when lock is opened, red when locked and will pulse red in case an invalid code is received.</p>
<p>The solution was conceived to operate on Bluetooth connectivity, with a smart device acting as the access code sender, but due to Tinkercad missing the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module (receiver) libraries, the smart device was replaced with a remote control and the receiver with an infrared (IR) sensor. For demonstration purposes, only three buttons of the remote (1, 4 and 7) will trigger the unlocking of the door, each with its own personalised user greeting, while the rest eighteen buttons act as invalid codes. </p>

<p>Due to updates to the IR Remote libraries, every putton on the remote sends the same code, making this little project inoperabile at the moment. I will try to work out a fix for this soon though</p>
